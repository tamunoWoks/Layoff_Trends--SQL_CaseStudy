# Tech Jobs Layoff Trends - An SQL CaseStudy
This is a data-driven study that focuses on tech industry job cuts from the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. I have used SQL(MySQL) for Analysis.

The dataset I will be working with is sourced from Kaggle; and the data availability is from when COVID-19 was declared as a pandemic i.e. 11 March 2020 to present (20 July 2024).
